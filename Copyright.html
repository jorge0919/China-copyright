China is a place where copying stuff is just normal like the Kentucky's Fried Chiken rip-off, Obama Fried Chiken because why not. I do not like China's idea of doing rip-offs of stuff people worked hard on. Chinas intelectual protection law lets people protect their inventions which posibly are other countries not related to China creations. A solution would be that china makes stuff of its own and not do rip-offs.
